* DESCRIPTION   : This function will erase sectors which configured in      *
*                 the init function.Note: used the main interface           *
* PARAMETERS    : u32LogicalAddress - Logical address from which the write  *
*                 should be started.                                        *
*                 u32Length - Length need to be erasing                     *
*                 bEnableBlankCheckAfterErasing - Enable/disable blank      *
*                 check after erasing(STD_ON/STD_OFF).                      *
*                 u8DomainIdValue    - The current Domain value that has    *
*                 started the Program or Erase sequence.                    *
*   (Domain ID can be changed, depending on XRDCs are enabled by the user)  *
* RETURN VALUES : FLS_INPUT_PARAM_FAILED    - Wrong input parameters        *
*                 FLS_JOB_FAILED            - Failed hardware condition.    *
*                 FLS_JOB_OK                - The data was blank            *
*                 FLS_TIMEOUT_FAILED        - wait for Done bit too long    *
*                 FLS_BLANK_CHECK_FAILED    - The data was not blank        *
